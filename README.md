# ETH-Fraud-Detection

This repository contains the implementation of our fraud detection framework for the Ethereum blockchain.

üîç **Overview**  
This project presents a scalable, semi-supervised framework for detecting fraudulent activities on the Ethereum blockchain.  
Our approach combines **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** with **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering** to model complex transactional relationships and uncover hidden fraud patterns, even with limited labeled data.

**Coming Soon**  
- Detailed documentation  
- Pretrained model checkpoints  
- Example usage and evaluation scripts  

Stay tuned ‚Äî more updates will be released shortly.
